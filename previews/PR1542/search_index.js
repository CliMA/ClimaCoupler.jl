Unfortunately, this is currently not the case in ClimaCoupler. The main reason for this is the complex interdependencies between component models and within ClimaAtmos which make the initialization step inconsistent. For example, in a coupled simulation, the surface albedo should be determined by the surface models and used by the atmospheric model for radiation transfer, but ClimaAtmos also tries to set the surface albedo (since it has to do so when run in standalone mode). In addition to this, ClimaAtmos has a large cache that has internal interdependencies that are hard to disentangle, and changing a field might require changing some other field in a different part of the cache. As a result, it is not easy for ClimaCoupler to consistently do initialization from a cold state. To conclude, restarting a simulation exclusively using the states of the component models is currently impossible.","category":"page"},{"location":"checkpointer/","page":"Checkpointer","title":"Checkpointer","text":"Given that restarting a simulation from the state is impossible, ClimaCoupler needs to save the states and the caches.
