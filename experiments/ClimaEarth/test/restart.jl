# This test runs a small AMIP simulation four times.
#
# - The first time the simulation is run for four steps
# - The second time the simulation is run for two steps
# - The third time the simulation is run for two steps, but restarting from the
#   second simulation
#
# After all these simulations are run, we compare the first and last runs. They
# should be bit-wise identical.
#
# The content of the simulation is not the most important, but it helps if it
# has all of the complexity possible.
