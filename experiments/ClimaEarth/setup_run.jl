## Logging
When Julia 1.10+ is used interactively, stacktraces contain reduced type information to make them shorter.
Given that ClimaCore objects are heavily parametrized, non-abbreviated stacktraces are hard to read,
so we force abbreviated stacktraces even in non-interactive runs.
(See also `Base.type_limited_string_from_context()`)
=#

redirect_stderr(IOContext(stderr, :stacktrace_types_limited => Ref(false)))

#=
## Configuration initialization
Here we import standard Julia packages, ClimaESM packages, parse in command-line arguments (if none are specified then the defaults in `cli_options.jl` apply).
We then specify the input data file names. If these are not already downloaded, include `artifacts/download_artifacts.jl`.

### Helper Functions
These will be eventually moved to their respective component model and utility packages, and so they should not
contain any internals of the ClimaCoupler source code, except extensions to the Interfacer functions.

### Configuration Dictionaries
Each simulation mode has its own configuration dictionary. The `config_dict` of each simulation is a merge of the default configuration
dictionary and the simulation-specific configuration dictionary, which allows the user to override the default settings.

We can additionally pass the configuration dictionary to the component model initializers, which will then override the default settings of the component models.

    ## Component Model Initialization
    Here we set initial and boundary conditions for each component model. Each component model is required to have an `init` function that
    returns a `ComponentModelSimulation` object (see `Interfacer` docs for more details).
    =#

    #=
    ### Atmosphere
    This uses the `ClimaAtmos.jl` model, with parameterization options specified in the `atmos_config_object` dictionary.

    thermo_params = get_thermo_params(atmos_sim) # TODO: this should be shared by all models #342

    #=
    ### Boundary Space
    We use a 2D boundary space at the surface for coupling operations.
    The boundary space is used to remap exchanged fields and compute fluxes between component models.

    We currently have two options for the boundary space:
    - `share_surface_space: true`: If `true`, we use the horizontal space of the atmosphere model as the boundary space.
      This is useful when the atmosphere and surface models are of the same resolution;
      this case makes remapping trivial, as the coupler can directly exchange fields and fluxes.
    - `share_surface_space: false`: If `false`, we create a boundary space independent of the component models,
      using the `ClimaCommonSpaces.CubedSphereSpace` constructor. This is useful when the
      atmosphere and surface models are of different resolutions or grid types. In this case,
      we need to remap exchanged fields and fluxes between component and boundary spaces.
    =#

    ## init a 2D boundary space at the surface

        boundary_space = CC.Spaces.horizontal_space(atmos_sim.domain.face_space)

    # Get surface elevation on the boundary space from `atmos` coordinate field
    surface_elevation = Interfacer.get_field(atmos_sim, Val(:height_sfc), boundary_space) # on surface space

    # Get atmospheric height on the boundary space
    # Since the atmospheric height is defined on centers, we need to copy the values onto the boundary space
    # to be able to subtract the surface elevation
    # Note: This pattern is not reliable and should not be reused.

    ### Land-sea Fraction
    This is a static field that contains the area fraction of land and sea, ranging from 0 to 1.
    If applicable, sea ice is included in the sea fraction at this stage.
    Note that land-sea area fraction is different to the land-sea mask, which is a binary field
    (masks are used internally by the coupler to indicate passive cells that are not populated by a given component model).

    ### Surface Models: AMIP and SlabPlanet Modes
    Both modes evolve `ClimaLand.jl`'s bucket model.

    In the `AMIP` mode, all ocean properties are prescribed from a file, while sea-ice temperatures are calculated using observed
    SIC and assuming a 2m thickness of the ice.

    In the `SlabPlanet` mode, all ocean and sea ice are dynamical models, namely thermal slabs, with different parameters. We have several `SlabPlanet` versions
    - `slabplanet` = land + slab ocean
    - `slabplanet_aqua` = slab ocean everywhere
    - `slabplanet_terra` = land everywhere

    In this section of the code, we initialize all component models and read in the prescribed data we'll be using.
    The specific models and data that are set up depend on which mode we're running.

Process the results after a simulation has completed, including generating

When `conservation_softfail` is true, throw an error if conservation is not
respected.

When `rmse_check` is true, compute the RMSE against observations and test
that it is below a certain threshold.

The postprocessing includes:
- Energy and water conservation checks (if running SlabPlanet with checks enabled)
- Animations (if not running in MPI)
- AMIP plots of the final state of the model
- Error against observations
- Optional additional atmosphere diagnostics plots
- Plots of useful coupler and component model fields for debugging
