# # AMIP Driver

#=
## Overview

AMIP is a standard experimental protocol of the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis & Intercomparison (PCMDI).
It is used as a model benchmark for the atmospheric and land model components, while sea-surface temperatures (SST) and sea-ice concentration (SIC)
are prescribed using time-interpolations between monthly observed data. We use standard data files with original sources:
- SST and SIC: https://gdex.ucar.edu/dataset/158_asphilli.html
- land-sea mask: https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Applications/Data/#cdf

For more information, see the PCMDI's specifications for [AMIP I](https://pcmdi.github.io/mips/amip/) and [AMIP II](https://pcmdi.github.io/mips/amip2/).

This driver contains two modes. The full `AMIP` mode and a `SlabPlanet` (all surfaces are thermal slabs) mode. Since `AMIP` is not a closed system, the
`SlabPlanet` mode is useful for checking conservation properties of the coupling.

## Logging
When Julia 1.10+ is used interactively, stacktraces contain reduced type information to make them shorter.
Given that ClimaCore objects are heavily parametrized, non-abbreviated stacktraces are hard to read,
so we force abbreviated stacktraces even in non-interactive runs.
(See also `Base.type_limited_string_from_context()`)
=#

redirect_stderr(IOContext(stderr, :stacktrace_types_limited => Ref(false)))

#=
## Configuration initialization
Here we import standard Julia packages, ClimaESM packages, parse in command-line arguments (if none are specified then the defaults in `cli_options.jl` apply).
We then specify the input data file names. If these are not already downloaded, include `artifacts/download_artifacts.jl`.

### Package Import
=#

## standard packages
import Dates

import ClimaCoupler.Interfacer:

### Helper Functions
These will be eventually moved to their respective component model and utility packages, and so they should not
contain any internals of the ClimaCoupler source code, except extensions to the Interfacer functions.
=#

## helpers for component models
include("components/atmosphere/climaatmos.jl")
include("components/land/climaland_bucket.jl")
include("components/ocean/slab_ocean.jl")
include("components/ocean/prescr_ocean.jl")
include("components/ocean/prescr_seaice.jl")
include("components/ocean/eisenman_seaice.jl")

#=
### Configuration Dictionaries
Each simulation mode has its own configuration dictionary. The `config_dict` of each simulation is a merge of the default configuration
dictionary and the simulation-specific configuration dictionary, which allows the user to override the default settings.

We can additionally pass the configuration dictionary to the component model initializers, which will then override the default settings of the component models.
=#

include("user_io/arg_parsing.jl")
include("user_io/postprocessing.jl")
config_dict = get_coupler_config()

# Select the correct timestep for each component model based on which are available
parse_component_dts!(config_dict)
# Add extra diagnostics if specified

### I/O Directory Setup `setup_output_dirs` returns `dir_paths.output =
COUPLER_OUTPUT_DIR`, which is the directory where the output of the simulation
will be saved, `dir_paths.artifacts` is the directory where the plots (from
postprocessing and the conservation checks) of the simulation will be saved,
#and `dir_paths.checkpoints`, where restart files are saved.
=#

COUPLER_OUTPUT_DIR = joinpath(output_dir_root, job_id)
dir_paths = Utilities.setup_output_dirs(output_dir = COUPLER_OUTPUT_DIR, comms_ctx = comms_ctx)

## Component Model Initialization
Here we set initial and boundary conditions for each component model. Each component model is required to have an `init` function that
returns a `ComponentModelSimulation` object (see `Interfacer` docs for more details).
=#

#=
### Atmosphere
This uses the `ClimaAtmos.jl` model, with parameterization options specified in the `atmos_config_object` dictionary.
=#

Utilities.show_memory_usage()

## init atmos model component
atmos_sim = ClimaAtmosSimulation(CA.AtmosConfig(atmos_config_dict));
# Get surface elevation from `atmos` coordinate field
surface_elevation = CC.Fields.level(CC.Fields.coordinate_field(atmos_sim.integrator.u.f).z, CC.Utilities.half)
Utilities.show_memory_usage()

thermo_params = get_thermo_params(atmos_sim) # TODO: this should be shared by all models #342

#=
### Boundary Space
We use a common `Space` for all global surfaces. This enables the MPI processes to operate on the same columns in both
the atmospheric and surface components, so exchanges are parallelized. Note this is only possible when the
atmosphere and surface are of the same horizontal resolution.

Currently, we use the 2D surface space from the atmosphere model as our shared space,
but ultimately we want this to specified within the coupler and passed to all component models. (see issue #665)
=#

## init a 2D boundary space at the surface
boundary_space = CC.Spaces.horizontal_space(atmos_sim.domain.face_space) # TODO: specify this in the coupler and pass it to all component models #665

#=
### Land-sea Fraction
This is a static field that contains the area fraction of land and sea, ranging from 0 to 1.
If applicable, sea ice is included in the sea fraction at this stage.
Note that land-sea area fraction is different to the land-sea mask, which is a binary field
(masks are used internally by the coupler to indicate passive cells that are not populated by a given component model).
=#

# Preprocess the file to be 1s and 0s before remapping into onto the grid
land_fraction = SpaceVaryingInput(land_mask_data, "landsea", boundary_space)
if !mono_surface
    land_fraction = Utilities.binary_mask.(land_fraction)
end
Utilities.show_memory_usage()

#=
### Surface Models: AMIP and SlabPlanet Modes
Both modes evolve `ClimaLand.jl`'s bucket model.

In the `AMIP` mode, all ocean properties are prescribed from a file, while sea-ice temperatures are calculated using observed
SIC and assuming a 2m thickness of the ice.

In the `SlabPlanet` mode, all ocean and sea ice are dynamical models, namely thermal slabs, with different parameters. We have several `SlabPlanet` versions
- `slabplanet` = land + slab ocean
- `slabplanet_aqua` = slab ocean everywhere
- `slabplanet_terra` = land everywhere
- `slabplanet_eisenman` = land + slab ocean + slab sea ice with an evolving thickness

In this section of the code, we initialize all component models and read in the prescribed data we'll be using.
The specific models and data that are set up depend on which mode we're running.

## Coupler Initialization
The coupler needs to contain exchange information, access all component models, and manage the calendar,
among other responsibilities.
Objects containing information to enable these are initialized here and saved in the
global `CoupledSimulation` struct, `cs`, below.

## Initialize Conservation Checks

The conservation checks are used to monitor the global energy and water conservation of the coupled system. The checks are only
applicable to the `slabplanet` mode, as the `amip` mode is not a closed system. The conservation checks are initialized here and
saved in a global `ConservationChecks` struct, `conservation_checks`, which is then stored as part of the larger `cs` struct.

end

#=
## Initialize Callbacks
Callbacks are used to update at a specified interval. The callbacks are initialized here and
saved in a global `Callbacks` struct, `callbacks`. The `trigger_callback!` function is used to call the callback during the simulation below.

The currently implemented callbacks are:
- `checkpoint_cb`: generates a checkpoint of all model states at a specified interval. This is mainly used for restarting simulations.
- `albedo_cb`: for the amip mode, the water albedo is time varying (since the reflectivity of water depends on insolation and wave characteristics, with the latter
  being approximated from wind speed). It is updated at the same frequency as the atmospheric radiation.
  NB: Eventually, we will call all of radiation from the coupler, in addition to the albedo calculation.

#=
## Initialize Coupled Simulation

The coupled simulation is initialized here and saved in a global `CoupledSimulation` struct, `cs`. It contains all the information
required to run the coupled simulation, including the communication context, the dates, the boundary space, the coupler fields, the
configuration dictionary, the conservation checks, the time span, the time step, the land fraction, the model simulations, the mode
specifics, the callbacks, the directory paths, and diagnostics for AMIP simulations.

## Restart component model states if specified
If a restart directory is specified and contains output files from the `checkpoint_cb` callback, the component model states are restarted from those files. The restart directory
is specified in the `config_dict` dictionary. The `restart_t` field specifies the time step at which the restart is performed.
=#

## Initialize Component Model Exchange

We need to ensure all models' initial conditions are shared to enable the coupler to calculate the first instance of surface fluxes. Some auxiliary variables (namely surface humidity and radiation fluxes)
depend on initial conditions of other component models than those in which the variables are calculated, which is why we need to step these models in time and/or reinitialize them.
The concrete steps for proper initialization are:
=#

# 1.coupler updates surface model area fractions
FieldExchanger.update_surface_fractions!(cs)

# 2.surface density (`ρ_sfc`): calculated by the coupler by adiabatically extrapolating atmospheric thermal state to the surface.
# For this, we need to import surface and atmospheric fields. The model sims are then updated with the new surface density.
FieldExchanger.import_combined_surface_fields!(cs.fields, cs.model_sims, cs.turbulent_fluxes)
FieldExchanger.import_atmos_fields!(cs.fields, cs.model_sims, cs.boundary_space, cs.turbulent_fluxes)
FieldExchanger.update_model_sims!(cs.model_sims, cs.fields, cs.turbulent_fluxes)

# 3.surface vapor specific humidity (`q_sfc`): step surface models with the new surface density to calculate their respective `q_sfc` internally
## TODO: the q_sfc calculation follows the design of the bucket q_sfc, but it would be neater to abstract this from step! (#331)
Interfacer.step!(land_sim, tspan[1] + Δt_cpl)
Interfacer.step!(ocean_sim, tspan[1] + Δt_cpl)
Interfacer.step!(ice_sim, tspan[1] + Δt_cpl)

# 4.turbulent fluxes: now we have all information needed for calculating the initial turbulent
# surface fluxes using either the combined state or the partitioned state method
if cs.turbulent_fluxes isa FluxCalculator.CombinedStateFluxesMOST
    ## import the new surface properties into the coupler (note the atmos state was also imported in step 3.)
    FieldExchanger.import_combined_surface_fields!(cs.fields, cs.model_sims, cs.turbulent_fluxes) # i.e. T_sfc, albedo, z0, beta, q_sfc
    ## calculate turbulent fluxes inside the atmos cache based on the combined surface state in each grid box
    FluxCalculator.combined_turbulent_fluxes!(cs.model_sims, cs.fields, cs.turbulent_fluxes) # this updates the atmos thermo state, sfc_ts
elseif cs.turbulent_fluxes isa FluxCalculator.PartitionedStateFluxes
    ## calculate turbulent fluxes in surface models and save the weighted average in coupler fields
    FluxCalculator.partitioned_turbulent_fluxes!(
        cs.model_sims,
        cs.fields,
        cs.boundary_space,
        FluxCalculator.MoninObukhovScheme(),
        cs.thermo_params,
    )

    ## update atmos sfc_conditions for surface temperature
    ## TODO: this is hard coded and needs to be simplified (req. CA modification) (#479)
    new_p = get_new_cache(atmos_sim, cs.fields)
    CA.SurfaceConditions.update_surface_conditions!(atmos_sim.integrator.u, new_p, atmos_sim.integrator.t) ## sets T_sfc (but SF calculation not necessary - requires split functionality in CA)
    atmos_sim.integrator.p.precomputed.sfc_conditions .= new_p.precomputed.sfc_conditions
end

# 5.reinitialize models + radiative flux: prognostic states and time are set to their initial conditions. For atmos, this also triggers the callbacks and sets a nonzero radiation flux (given the new sfc_conditions)
FieldExchanger.reinit_model_sims!(cs.model_sims)

# 6.update all fluxes: coupler re-imports updated atmos fluxes (radiative fluxes for both `turbulent_fluxes` types
# and also turbulent fluxes if `turbulent_fluxes isa CombinedStateFluxesMOST`,
# and sends them to the surface component models. If `turbulent_fluxes isa PartitionedStateFluxes`
# atmos receives the turbulent fluxes from the coupler.
FieldExchanger.import_atmos_fields!(cs.fields, cs.model_sims, cs.boundary_space, cs.turbulent_fluxes)
FieldExchanger.update_model_sims!(cs.model_sims, cs.fields, cs.turbulent_fluxes)

#=
## Coupling Loop

The coupling loop is the main part of the simulation. It runs the component models sequentially for one coupling timestep (`Δt_cpl`) at a time,
and exchanges combined fields and calculates fluxes using the selected turbulent fluxes option.
Note that we want to implement this in a dispatchable function to allow for other forms of timestepping (e.g. leapfrog).

## Precompilation of Coupling Loop

Here we run the entire coupled simulation for two timesteps to precompile everything
for accurate timing of the overall simulation. After these two steps, we update the
beginning and end of the simulation timespan to the correct values.
=#

## run the coupled simulation for two timesteps to precompile
cs.tspan[2] = tspan[1] + Δt_cpl * 2
solve_coupler!(cs)

## update the timespan to the correct values
cs.tspan[1] = tspan[1] + Δt_cpl * 2
cs.tspan[2] = tspan[2]

## Run garbage collection before solving for more accurate memory comparison to ClimaAtmos
GC.gc()

#=
## Solving and Timing the Full Simulation

This is where the full coupling loop, `solve_coupler!` is called for the full timespan of the simulation.
We use the `ClimaComms.@elapsed` macro to time the simulation on both CPU and GPU, and use this
value to calculate the simulated years per day (SYPD) of the simulation.
=#
walltime = ClimaComms.@elapsed comms_ctx.device begin
    s = CA.@timed_str begin
        solve_coupler!(cs)
    end
end
@info(walltime)

## Use ClimaAtmos calculation to show the simulated years per day of the simulation (SYPD)
es = CA.EfficiencyStats(tspan, walltime)
sypd = CA.simulated_years_per_day(es)
n_atmos_steps = atmos_sim.integrator.step
walltime_per_atmos_step = es.walltime / n_atmos_steps
@info "SYPD: $sypd"
@info "Walltime per Atmos step: $(walltime_per_atmos_step)"

## Save the SYPD and allocation information
if ClimaComms.iamroot(comms_ctx)
    open(joinpath(dir_paths.artifacts, "sypd.txt"), "w") do sypd_filename
        println(sypd_filename, "$sypd")
    end

    open(joinpath(dir_paths.artifacts, "walltime_per_atmos_step.txt"), "w") do walltime_per_atmos_step_filename
        println(walltime_per_atmos_step_filename, "$(walltime_per_atmos_step)")
    end

    open(joinpath(dir_paths.artifacts, "max_rss_cpu.txt"), "w") do cpu_max_rss_filename
        cpu_max_rss_GB = Utilities.show_memory_usage()
        println(cpu_max_rss_filename, cpu_max_rss_GB)

## Postprocessing
All postprocessing is performed using the root process only, if applicable.
Our postprocessing consists of outputting a number of plots to visualize the model output.

The postprocessing includes:
- Energy and water conservation checks (if running SlabPlanet with checks enabled)
- Animations (if not running in MPI)
- AMIP plots of the final state of the model
- Error against observations
- Optional additional atmosphere diagnostics plots
- Plots of useful coupler and component model fields for debugging

    postprocessing_vars = (; use_coupler_diagnostics, output_default_diagnostics, t_end, conservation_softfail)
