# # AMIP Driver

## Overview

AMIP is a standard experimental protocol of the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis & Intercomparison (PCMDI).
It is used as a model benchmark for the atmospheric and land model components, while sea-surface temperatures (SST) and sea-ice concentration (SIC)
are prescribed using time-interpolations between monthly observed data. We use standard data files with original sources:
- SST and SIC: https://gdex.ucar.edu/dataset/158_asphilli.html
- land-sea mask: https://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Applications/Data/#cdf

For more information, see the PCMDI's specifications for [AMIP I](https://pcmdi.github.io/mips/amip/) and [AMIP II](https://pcmdi.github.io/mips/amip2/).

This driver contains two modes. The full `AMIP` mode and a `SlabPlanet` (all surfaces are thermal slabs) mode. Since `AMIP` is not a closed system, the
`SlabPlanet` mode is useful for checking conservation properties of the coupling.
