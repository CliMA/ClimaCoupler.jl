Unfortunately, this is currently not the case in ClimaCoupler. The main reason for this is the complex interdependencies between component models and within ClimaAtmos which make the initialization step inconsistent. For example, in a coupled simulation, the surface albedo should be determined by the surface models and used by the atmospheric model for radiation transfer, but ClimaAtmos also tries to set the surface albedo (since it has to do so when run in standalone mode). In addition to this, ClimaAtmos has a large cache that has internal interdependencies that are hard to disentangle, and changing a field might require changing some other field in a different part of the cache. As a result, it is not easy for ClimaCoupler to consistently do initialization from a cold state. To conclude, restarting a simulation exclusively using the states of the component models is currently impossible.","category":"page"},{"location":"checkpointer/","page":"Checkpointer","title":"Checkpointer","text":"Given that restarting a simulation from the state is impossible, ClimaCoupler needs to save the states and the caches.

Instead, references to already-processed objects are reused.\nSelective saving: Only the parts of the cache needed for restoration are saved.\nRecreated views: Views are preserved by recreating the views with the parent arrays on CPU.

The coupler exchange fields may also hold quantities from components that are used to compute turbulent fluxes. As a general rule, we tend to store such quantities that come from the atmosphere model, but access them when needed for surface models. This is because we compute fluxes indvidually for the interface between each surface and the atmosphere model.
